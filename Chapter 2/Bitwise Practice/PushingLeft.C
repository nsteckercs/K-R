#include <stdio.h>

/*
    << takes two operands
    o1 << o2
    o1 is the operand you want to shift bits on
    o2 is how many bits you want to shift

    var = 3;
    var << 1 is equal to 6

    o1 = 2^o2 or right operand
    so, 3 << 1 is equal to [3 x 2^1] which is equal to 6
    3 << 4 is equal to [3 x 2^4] which is equal to 48


    >> is the same but goes right
    equivalent to diving by 2^o2 or right operand.

    3 >> 1 is equal to [3 / 2^1] which is equal to 1 (takes off decimal point)
